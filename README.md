### Intro

In this repo you can find the projects I'm working on this semester. This semester is split between a group and a individual project. My project partner for the individual project is @RicoCelsius. In this Readme I will put links to the individual project and the group project. I also provide proof for each learning outcome with links to parts of a project.
